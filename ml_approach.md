# ML Approach - Hybrid LLM to Machine Learning Pipeline

## Overview

CrohnCare uses a phased approach that transitions from LLM-powered insights to personalized machine learning models as user data accumulates. This ensures immediate value while building toward highly accurate predictions.

-----

## Phase 1: Days 1-30 (LLM-Powered Initial Insights)

### Data Collection

During this initial phase, the focus is on collecting raw, timestamped user entries. The data is kept simple and structured as individual documents or records in a database like MongoDB.

  * **Food Entries:** Basic food entries with pre-tagged nutritional properties.
  * **Symptom Logs:** Standardized scales for symptom severity.
  * **Contextual Data:** Simple logs for stress, sleep, and medication.

### Example Input Data (Raw JSON Logs)

This is how the data might look as it's collected in the database.

**Food Entry Log:**

```json
{
  "userId": "user_123",
  "entryId": "food_001",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-15T12:30:00Z",
  "mealType": "Lunch",
  "items": [
    {
      "name": "Turkey Sandwich",
      "portion": "1",
      "ingredients": ["turkey breast", "whole wheat bread", "lettuce", "mayonnaise"],
      "tags": ["processed_meat", "gluten", "low-fiber"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Apple",
      "portion": "1 medium",
      "tags": ["fruit", "high-fiber"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Symptom Log:**

```json
{
  "userId": "user_123",
  "entryId": "symptom_001",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-15T15:45:00Z",
  "symptoms": [
    { "name": "Abdominal Pain", "severity": 7 },
    { "name": "Bloating", "severity": 8 }
  ]
}
```

**Context Log:**

```json
{
  "userId": "user_123",
  "entryId": "context_001",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-15T09:00:00Z",
  "stressLevel": 6,
  "sleepQuality": 5,
  "medicationAdherence": true
}
```

### LLM Integration & Input

The raw logs are aggregated and formatted into a structured prompt for the LLM. This prompt combines the user's recent data with general medical knowledge to generate preliminary insights.

**Example LLM Input Prompt:**

```
Analyze the following data for a Crohn's disease patient to identify potential dietary triggers based on established medical research.

**Patient's Recent Data:**
- **Meal:** Turkey Sandwich (tags: processed_meat, gluten) and an Apple (tags: high-fiber) eaten at 12:30 PM.
- **Symptoms:** Abdominal Pain (7/10) and Bloating (8/10) reported at 3:45 PM.
- **Context:** Stress level was 6/10 today.

**Medical Knowledge Base:**
- High-fiber foods like apples can sometimes exacerbate symptoms during a flare-up.
- Gluten is a common trigger for some individuals with IBD.
- Processed meats can be inflammatory.

**Task:**
Provide a preliminary insight about potential triggers, a confidence rating (Low, Medium), and the reasoning.
```

### Example Phase 1 Output

The output is presented as an "Early Insight" on the user's dashboard. It's educational, cautious, and designed to manage expectations.

```markdown
### Early Insight: A Note on Fiber

**Potential Trigger:** High-Fiber Foods (like the apple in your lunch)

**What Research Says:** Some studies suggest that high-fiber foods, especially raw fruits and vegetables, can sometimes be difficult to digest and may worsen symptoms like bloating and abdominal pain for individuals with active Crohn's inflammation. The fiber can be abrasive to an inflamed intestinal lining.

**Confidence:** `Low`

> **Disclaimer:** This is a preliminary insight based on your first few entries combined with general medical research. It is not a personalized prediction. Continue tracking consistently to help the system learn your unique patterns.
```

-----

## Phase 2: Days 31-90 (LLM + Pattern Recognition)

### Enhanced Data Analysis

In this phase, the system begins to aggregate the raw logs into a more structured, tabular format. Simple statistical analysis is performed to identify initial patterns and correlations.

  * **Correlation Analysis:** Link foods to symptoms that occur within a specific time window.
  * **Frequency Analysis:** Identify foods or tags frequently consumed on days with high symptom scores.
  * **Timing Patterns:** Calculate the average delay between meals and symptom onset.

### Example Input Data (Aggregated for Analysis)

The data is now transformed into a flattened structure, suitable for simple correlation models and for providing more context to the LLM.

```json
[
  {
    "date": "2025-07-15",
    "userId": "user_123",
    "daily_avg_pain": 6.5,
    "daily_avg_bloating": 7.0,
    "consumed_food_tags": ["gluten", "high-fiber", "processed_meat"],
    "meal_to_symptom_delay_hours": 3.25,
    "symptom_correlation_strength": {
      "gluten": 0.3,
      "high-fiber": 0.4
    },
    "stress_correlation": 0.2
  },
  {
    "date": "2025-07-16",
    "userId": "user_123",
    "daily_avg_pain": 3.0,
    "daily_avg_bloating": 2.5,
    "consumed_food_tags": ["dairy-free", "low-fiber", "grilled-chicken"],
    "meal_to_symptom_delay_hours": null,
    "symptom_correlation_strength": {},
    "stress_correlation": 0.1
  }
]
```

### Hybrid Approach

The LLM now receives both the raw data and the emerging patterns, allowing it to provide more nuanced insights that reference the user's own data.

**Example LLM Input with Patterns:**

```
Analyze the data for a Crohn's patient. Combine the user's emerging patterns with medical knowledge.

**Patient's Emerging Patterns:**
- **Correlation:** High-fiber foods show a moderate positive correlation (0.4) with bloating.
- **Timing:** Symptoms tend to appear ~3 hours after meals containing high-fiber items.
- **Frequency:** On days with bloating scores > 6, 'high-fiber' was logged 80% of the time.

**Today's Data:**
- **Meal:** Salad with raw vegetables (tags: high-fiber, raw) at 1:00 PM.
- **Symptoms:** Bloating (7/10) at 4:30 PM.

**Task:**
Provide an insight that references both the user's personal data patterns and medical research. Assign a confidence rating (Low, Medium, High).
```

### Example Phase 2 Output

The output now references the user's own data, making the insight feel more relevant. The confidence level increases as personal data supports the general research.

```markdown
### Your Emerging Pattern: Fiber and Bloating

**Potential Trigger:** High-Fiber Foods

**Your Personal Data Shows:**
- We've noticed a **moderate correlation (0.4 strength)** between the days you log high-fiber foods and an increase in your bloating severity.
- Symptoms of bloating tend to appear **~3 hours** after you eat a meal high in fiber.

**What this Means:** Your personal data is beginning to align with established research. This pattern is becoming more consistent, suggesting that high-fiber foods might be a trigger for *you*.

**Confidence:** `Medium`

> **Next Step:** We are getting closer to making personalized predictions. Keep logging to confirm this pattern. **(55 days until your full ML model is ready!)**
```

## Phase 3: Days 91+ (Full Machine Learning Pipeline)

### Feature Engineering

With sufficient data, the focus shifts to building a rich feature set for sophisticated machine learning models. The data is transformed into a wide, numerical format.

  * **Time-Lagged Features:** Include symptom and context data from previous time windows (e.g., 6, 12, 24 hours ago).
  * **Interaction Features:** Create new features by combining existing ones (e.g., stress level multiplied by intake of a potential trigger).
  * **Categorical Encoding:** Convert food tags and other categorical data into a numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding).

### Example Input Data (Feature-Engineered for ML Model)

This is a sample row of the final dataset used to train the Random Forest or XGBoost models. Each row represents a specific point in time, and the goal is to predict the `symptom_flare_in_6h`.

| timestamp | userId | pain\_severity\_1h\_ago | bloating\_severity\_1h\_ago | stress\_level | sleep\_quality\_24h\_ago | consumed\_gluten | consumed\_dairy | consumed\_high\_fiber | meal\_time\_since\_last | stress\_x\_gluten | predicted\_trigger | actual\_trigger\_feedback | symptom\_flare\_in\_6h |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025-09-15T12:00Z | user\_123 | 2 | 3 | 7 | 8 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 4.5 | 7 | Gluten | Yes | 1 |
| 2025-09-15T13:00Z | user\_123 | 4 | 5 | 7 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1.0 | 0 | None | N/A | 1 |
| 2025-09-16T08:00Z | user\_123 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 12.0 | 0 | High-Fiber | No | 0 |

**Column Explanations:**

  * **Lagged Features:** `pain_severity_1h_ago`, `sleep_quality_24h_ago`
  * **One-Hot Encoded Features:** `consumed_gluten`, `consumed_dairy`, `consumed_high_fiber`
  * **Interaction Feature:** `stress_x_gluten` (stress level at the time gluten was consumed)
  * **Prediction Columns:**
      * `predicted_trigger`: The output from the ML model.
      * `actual_trigger_feedback`: A column populated by user feedback confirming or denying the prediction. This is crucial for retraining.
  * **Target Variable:** `symptom_flare_in_6h` (a binary flag indicating if a symptom flare is likely in the next 6 hours).

### Example Phase 3 Output

The output is now a direct, actionable prediction from the user's personalized machine learning model. It provides a specific risk assessment with high confidence and explains the "why" behind the prediction.

```markdown
### Today's Flare-Up Risk Assessment

**Prediction:** **High Risk** of Abdominal Pain & Bloating in the next 4-6 hours.

**Primary Predicted Trigger:** `Dairy` (from your recent meal)

**Key Contributing Factors:**
1.  **Your history with Dairy:** Your model has learned that dairy has an 82% probability of triggering your symptoms.
2.  **High Stress Level Today:** Your current stress level (8/10) has historically amplified the effects of your triggers.
3.  **Recent Poor Sleep:** Lower sleep quality last night has made you more susceptible to flares today.

**Confidence:** `High (91%)`

**Actionable Advice:** Consider having a low-FODMAP, gentle dinner. Prioritize rest and stress-reduction activities this evening.
